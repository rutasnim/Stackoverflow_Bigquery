# Exploratory Data Analysis on Stackoverflow posts with BigQuery
In this project, I explored  stackoverflow posts dataset on BigQuery. I explored the structure and also discovered the following:

1.   the popular topics on stackoverflow by lifetime and also by years
2.   the top topics that were asked by lifetime and by years
3.   The most difficult topics
4.   Does using the word "help" in stackoverflow post will help get answers?
